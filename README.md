A beginner-friendly Sales Analysis project that explores a companyâ€™s transactional data using core Python data tools to answer practical business questions. It loads raw sales records, cleans and aggregates them with Pandas, and visualizes trends such as revenue by month, top-performing products, and regional performance using Matplotlib, with efficient numerical operations powered by NumPy.

Feature highlights
Get quick KPIs like total revenue, average order value, growth rates, and profit margins to summarize business performance.
Analyze product-, category-, and region-level sales to identify bestsellers, underperformers, and seasonality patterns.
Visualize time-series trends, monthly seasonality, and distribution plots to turn raw numbers into actionable insights.

Tech stack
Built with Python and the essentials: Pandas for data wrangling, NumPy for fast computations, and Matplotlib for charts.
Designed to run in a Jupyter Notebook or a simple Python script, making it easy to read, tweak, and extend.
Keeps the code modular so additional charts (e.g., top customers, discount impact) can be added without friction.

Typical workflow
Import CSV sales data, parse dates, and standardize columns for reliable analysis.
Create grouped summaries and pivot-style aggregations to compare sales across products, channels, and time periods.
Plot clear visuals (line, bar, and pie where appropriate) to highlight trends, seasonality, and anomalies.

What this helps with
Quickly spot revenue drivers and slow-moving items for inventory and marketing decisions.
Understand seasonal spikes and dips to support forecasting and promotional planning.
Produce presentation-ready visuals and metrics for reports, dashboards, or stakeholder updates.
